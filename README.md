# Sygnia's Backend Dev Task

Hi!  
We hope the process is going well for you so far.

Please follow the instructions below, and don't hesitate to ask us for anything you need.

The dev task is currently available in the following programming languages:
* Python (both `the_big_bang.py` and `the_big_bang.ipynb` are available)
* Go (`big_bang.go` and `big_bang_test.go`)
* Node.js (`big_bang.js`)


## Instructions

If you prefer to develop locally: 
1. Clone the repo
2. Choose the relevant file based on your preferred programming language
3. Follow the instructions in the file


If **Python** is your favorite language, and you prefer working with Jupyter Notebook, you can also use **Binder**:
1. Go to [https://mybinder.org/](https://mybinder.org/)

2. Set [https://github.com/SygniaLabs/backend-dev-task](https://github.com/SygniaLabs/backend-dev-task) as the GitHub repository URL and hit launch

3. Open `the_big_bang.ipynb` and follow the instructions there


Once you are done:
1. Download the notebook file as .ipynb, or take the relevant py/go/js file
2. Zip the file
3. Mail it to: `michael.h@sygnia.co`

### Good luck!
